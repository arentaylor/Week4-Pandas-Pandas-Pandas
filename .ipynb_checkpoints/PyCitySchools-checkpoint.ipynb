    "1. For each of the schools, there is no significant variation in the averages scores between the grades, which may support the conclusion that, where we have lower performing schools, the issue is school-wide and not due to the curriculum or staff for a particular grade.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Higher spending per student is associated with a negative impact on student scores, especially math. Though this may seem counter-intuitive, we don't know what the \"extra\" money is being spent on. Perhaps it is going to facilities rather than instructor recruiting and salaries. The association does, however, indicate that spending is not likely the solution to a school's woes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Larger school size is associated with a negative impact on student scores, again, especially math. This may lend more weight to the theory posited above that the extra spending at these schools is not going toward skilled teachers, or just more teachers. In these larger schools, perhaps the students suffer because each teacher is responsible for a larger number of students."
